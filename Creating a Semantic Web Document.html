                <h3>Historical Examples of Mutualism</h3>

                <h3>Mutualism in Modern Life</h3>

                <p>In today's world, mutualism can be seen in workplace collaborations, community support systems, and sustainable business practices. Worker-owned cooperatives, such as the Mondragon Corporation in Spain, demonstrate how mutualism can create thriving businesses that benefit both workers and the community. Additionally, companies that offer employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) allow employees to become shareholders, aligning their interests with the company's success.</p>
